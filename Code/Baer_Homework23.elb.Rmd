Lets set it up

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```


Okay awesome, now lets bring in some data

```{r}
Soil<-read.csv(here("Data", "soil_data.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

open the dataset and see what we are working with

```{r}
View(Soil)
```


Okay now lets make a plot looking at SOM_percent

just by forest, so name the sites just DeGrasse and just Donnerville (not sites within those)

```{r}
Soil%>%
  filter(Field.Name)%>%
  mutate(Forest_Name<-)

```



```{r}
geom_point(Feild.Name, SOM_percent, )
```
You didn't finish this homework by a long shot. There is a lot of code missing. Be sure to see the key if you need help understanding it, or see me.
